# Computing-Work

A new criminal had arrived at the prison entrance. His shirt was ragged and torn; he had gashes on his arms and legs; his hair was unkempt and he hung his head low, wrists cuffed.
With a yank, my colleague like a dog led him to me. As a prison guard (warden), I had to face prisoners regularly and I was already used to it by now. However, my heart still
aches whenever I have to witness someone in such a state. My colleague handed the prisoner’s ‘leash’ to me to bring this prisoner to his designated cell. Two prison guards were
commanded to tail behind us in case this criminal resorted to violence. Just then, the prisoner lifted his head slightly. Our eyes met. He looked familiar... Hold up. Isn’t he the tough guy who used to bully and taunt me back in our school days? The same angry shots his eyes gave, the same ruffled hair dyed red, and I instantly realised that his facial features had not changed much either the closer I looked. 
He scrutinised my face simultaneously and I had an uneasy feeling that he could recognise me too. The anger in his eyes turned to mischief.
